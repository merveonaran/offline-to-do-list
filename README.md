# offline-to-do-list
A to do list project created using PWA techniques

The difference of this project from other to do lists is that you can download like an application when you open it in your browser. <br>IndexDb<br/> was used to hold the data. The reason we prefer this is that it supports offline working. Since we are working with Service Worker, do not forget to use npm install and npm start commands in terminal respectively. If you do not use these residences, you can only run them as a website, but you will not be able to benefit from some features such as downloading the application.<br>
css part of this project will be updated.
